# Truth Window Documentation

## What is a Truth Window?

A **truth window** is a transparent record of what was requested and what was actually delivered during development sessions. The concept is borrowed from traditional architecture, where builders would leave a small window in a wall to show the quality of construction materials and techniques used inside.

In software development, truth windows serve as:
- **Transparency**: Clear documentation of requests vs. implementation
- **Accountability**: Honest recording of what was accomplished
- **Learning**: Reference material for understanding decisions and processes
- **Quality Assurance**: Evidence of thorough work and attention to detail

## How This Folder Works

Each file in this folder documents a specific development session, following the naming convention:
```
session-YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md
```

### Session Document Structure

Every truth window document follows this format:

```markdown
# Truth Window - Session YYYY-MM-DD (Brief Description)

## What You Asked:
[Numbered list of specific requests made]

## What I Did:
[Detailed breakdown of actions taken, with checkmarks âœ… for completed items]

### Technical Implementation:
[Code changes, file modifications, technical details]

### Git Changes:
[Commit information, file changes, hashes]

## Session Summary:
[High-level overview of accomplishments and current state]
```

## Why Truth Windows Matter

### For Users:
- **Verification**: Confirm your requests were understood and implemented correctly
- **Reference**: Review what was done and why
- **Progress Tracking**: See cumulative improvements over time
- **Communication**: Clear record reduces misunderstandings

### For Development:
- **Quality Control**: Forces thorough documentation of all changes
- **Debugging**: Historical context for understanding code evolution
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Future developers can understand decision rationale
- **Process Improvement**: Patterns in requests/implementations become visible

## Inspired by Straw House Building

This documentation approach is inspired by traditional building practices where craftsmen would include "truth windows" - small sections left exposed to show the quality of materials and construction techniques used within the walls.

Just as a truth window in construction shows:
- **Materials used** (what technologies/approaches were chosen)
- **Construction quality** (how well the work was executed)  
- **Structural integrity** (whether the implementation is sound)
- **Craftsmanship** (attention to detail and best practices)

Our truth windows in software development reveal:
- **Requirements understanding** (how requests were interpreted)
- **Implementation quality** (technical execution and best practices)
- **Problem-solving approach** (methodology and reasoning)
- **Completeness** (thorough addressing of all aspects)

## How to Use This Documentation

### When Adding New Features:
1. Review similar past implementations in existing truth windows
2. Understand patterns and approaches that worked well
3. Learn from any challenges or edge cases encountered

### When Debugging Issues:
1. Find the truth window for when the feature was implemented
2. Review the technical details and reasoning
3. Check if current issues were anticipated or addressed

### When Onboarding:
1. Read recent truth windows to understand project evolution
2. See examples of good request/implementation patterns
3. Learn the codebase through documented changes

## Best Practices

### For Requesting Work:
- Be specific about desired outcomes
- Provide context for why changes are needed
- Include examples or references when helpful

### for Implementation:
- Document not just what was done, but why
- Include code examples for significant changes
- Note any assumptions or decisions made
- Record both successes and challenges

### For Maintenance:
- Create a truth window for every development session
- Use descriptive filenames that make sessions easy to find
- Keep the format consistent for easy scanning
- Include relevant git commit information

*Remember: The goal is not perfect documentation, but honest and useful documentation that helps everyone understand what really happened during development.*
